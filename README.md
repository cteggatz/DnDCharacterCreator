# DnDCharacterCreator
**this is a work in progress**
this is just a random project that I decided to work on.
I really wanted to make something simolar to D&D beyonds automatic character creator, still give you some freedom but crunch all of the numbers down
so you dont have to do any of the math. The goal of this project is to make a character creator that can edit a pdf/JPEG of a DND character sheet so you can 
just print out your character with the math and default abilities already plugged in.
